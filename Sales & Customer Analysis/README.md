📝 PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project was created as part of the Tata Forage Job Simulation.
The goal was to analyze sales and customer data, build insights on revenue performance, and design an interactive Tableau dashboard for decision-making.

💡 Key Insights
  - Revenue Growth peaked during holiday season (Nov–Dec 2011).
  - UK contributed the highest volume of orders but had weaker retention compared to smaller markets.
  - Repeat customers generated more revenue per capita than first-time buyers.
  - Retention dropped significantly after the first month, showing a need for re-engagement campaigns.

🎯 Objectives
Build an interactive Sales Dashboard to track orders, quantity, and revenue.
Build a Customer Dashboard to analyze retention, purchase frequency, and loyalty.
Conduct a Cohort Analysis to understand customer purchase latency (time between first and repeat purchase).
Provide actionable insights valuable to both operations (CEO) and marketing (CMO) teams.
