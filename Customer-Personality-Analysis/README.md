PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes customer demographics and spending behavior. The goal is to provide actionable insights for marketing teams by identifying high-value customers and understanding purchasing patterns.

Objectives:
1. Summarize customer demographics by age, education level, and marital status.
2. Analyze spending behavior (total and average spending per customer).
3. Segment customers into High, Medium, and Low value groups.
4. Enable interactive filtering using slicers for dynamic data exploration.
5. Highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Customers, Average Spending, and High-Value Customers.

Key Insights:
•	Middle-aged customers are revenue drivers because they show the highest spending across all education levels, likely due to peak earning capacity and established household needs.
•	Education equals spending power as postgraduates and doctorate holders consistently outspends other education levels, indicating products appeal to higher income, educated demographics.
•	Massive growth opportunity exists since only 11% of your 2,241 customers are classified as high-value, suggesting significant potential to convert medium-value customers.
•	Seasonal spending patterns are strong with clear peaks in May and December and a mid-year July dip, indicating holiday and bonus-driven purchasing behavior.
•	Married customers dominate base at 76% showing products and services strongly appeal to household decision-makers with family-oriented purchasing patterns.
